# :spades: Description

This repository contains all programs developed in **C++** while studying **computer science** at Federal University of Minas Gerais **(UFMG)**.

# :rocket: Running

To run any program, use `g++` to compile them through the root folder:

`g++ ./<folder-name>/<filename>.cpp -o ./main.out && ./main.out`

Change `<folder-name>` and `<filename>` by the desired program directory.

Example: `g++ ./introduction/helloWorld.cpp -o ./main.out && ./main.out`

You can generate `main.out` with another extension like `.exe`, so use the one that works on your OS.

# :waxing_crescent_moon: Memory
