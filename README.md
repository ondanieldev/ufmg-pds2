# :spades: Description

This repository contains all programs developed in **C++** while studying **computer science** at Federal University of Minas Gerais **(UFMG)**.

# :rocket: Running

To run any program, use `g++` to compile them through the own folder:

`g++ <filename>.cpp <implementation>.cpp -o ./main.out && ./main.out`

Change `<filename>` and `<implementation>` by the desired program and implementations (if exists).

Example inside the `fundamentals/introduction` folder: `g++ helloWorld.cpp -o ./main.out && ./main.out`

You can generate `main.out` with another extension like `.exe`, so use the one that works on your OS.

# :new_moon: Fundamentals

The folder `fundamentals` contains all programs developed in the first module of the course, such as: **introduction**, **memory**, **Abstract Data Types** and **Standard Template Library**.

## Introduction

The folder `introduction` contains basic programs to learn and pratice **C++ syntax**.

## Memory

The folder `memory` contains programs to learn about **pointers** and **dynamic memory**.

## ADTs - Abstract Data Types

The folder `abstractDataTypes` contains programs to learn about **adts**, **structs** and **good practices** when developing definitions and implementations.

## STL - Standard Template Library

The folder `standardTemplateLibrary` contains programs to learn about **STL**, the main C++ library to work with **containers**, **iterators** and **algorithms**.

# :waxing_crescent_moon: POO Basic

The folder `poo_basic` contains all programs developed in the third module of the course, such as: **attributes**, **methods**, **encapsulation**, **inheritance** and **polimorfism**.
